# Understanding-Breast-Cancer-Data-
Software Design For Responsible Intelligent Systems-- Project 1

## Project Description
This project aims to predict the recurrence of breast cancer in patients using a dataset obtained from the class Git repository. The dataset consists of 9 independent features and 1 dependent target variable, which represents whether a patient experiences recurrence or not. The goal is to explore the dataset through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and build classification models to predict recurrence effectively.
## Dataset Details
The dataset includes various attributes related to patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and treatment details.
Features of the Dataset:
- Independent Features
  - Age
  - Menopause status
  - Tumor size
  - Number of involved lymph nodes (inv-nodes)
  - Presence of node caps (node-caps)
  - Degree of malignancy (deg-malig)
  - Breast affected (left or right)
  - Tumor quadrant location (breast-quad)
  - Radiation therapy history (irradiat)
- Target Variable
  - Class (Recurrence or No Recurrence)
